## Overview

In this project, customer reviews from an e-commerce platform are processed and analyzed using sentiment analysis. The project uses text mining techniques to preprocess the reviews and a **Logistic Regression** model for sentiment classification.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering reviews data from an e-commerce platform.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the text data, remove stopwords, and apply lemmatization.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Use **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text into numerical vectors.
4. **Model Training**: Train a logistic regression classifier to classify reviews as positive or negative.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for the project.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: Handling arrays and numerical data.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model building and evaluation.
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit for text preprocessing.
- **TfidfVectorizer**: For converting text into TF-IDF features.
- **Logistic Regression**: Used for classification of sentiments (positive/negative).
